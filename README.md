* /operations/flyway - Shows any `Flyway` database migrations that have been applied.
* /operations/health - Shows application health information.
* /operations/info - Displays arbitrary application info.
* /operations/liquibase - Shows any `Liquibase` database migrations that have been applied.
* /operations/logfile - Returns the contents of the logfile (if logging.file or logging.path properties have been set).
